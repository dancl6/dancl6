Full Stack Engineer with extensive technical training and excellent leadership, problem solving, and communication skills.  As a polished mechanical engineer who guided staff, maintained documentation, and followed best practices, I utilized my unique skill set and prior technical acumen to excel in a bootcamp where I created 30+ web applications.  I am accustomed to working in teams by collaborating closely with 7 team members, debugging, and improving code as needed.  I am now eager to apply my unique technical skills and experience in a position solving back-end problems using JavaScript and SQL while working in collaboration with other developers, and demonstrating strong work ethic and integrity where clean and effective code can be mutually developed.
